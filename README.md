# Titanic-Data-With-ML :raised_hand_with_fingers_splayed:

*The pipeline consists of several steps:*

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - understanding the data and the underlying interactions between the different variables
2. Data Pre-processing - preparing the data for modelling
3. Building the model
4. Evaluating the performance of the model, and possibly fine-tune and tweak it if necessary

The goal of the model is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster, given their age, class and a few other features.
